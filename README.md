# SmartHome-In-Wall-IOT

Smart Home in-wall IOT modules with ESP8266.

* Modules must fit in standard electric wall boxes (European Batibox)
* Limit the number of components for DIY feasibility
* Common logic board and different power boards

This GitHub contains PCB files and source code samples.

Designed to be used with Arduino and REST API or Souliss, OpenHab,...

##Hardware


##Software
Arduino source code sample for each module, can works out of the box but understanding Souliss architecture and configration is requied to build a Smart Home Network with a lot of modules nodes.
